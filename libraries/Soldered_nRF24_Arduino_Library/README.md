Connecting the NRF24L01 can be tricky - you have to pay attention to the layout of the pins, adjust them to match those from the library and add a capacitor. This board solves all that, and it already comes with soldered headers, so just plug this board into your Dasduino and that's it!

- Comes with NRF24L01+ module
- Dimensions: 38 x 22 mm
